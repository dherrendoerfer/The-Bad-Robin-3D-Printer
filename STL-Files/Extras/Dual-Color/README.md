## Multi Meaterial Mod Files
These files are for a modification to support dual material/color print 
Note that the tubes inside the Y-mixer need to be lined with PTFE tube, and the end of the joining (single) tube should be opened up with a drill to help with the insertion of the filament.

The firmware for the dual color mod and the tool-change scripts are not freely available yet, please contact me for a copy if you can't get it to work yourself. 

###This is still Work-In-Progress
