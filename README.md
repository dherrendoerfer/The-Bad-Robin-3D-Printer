# The Bad Robin 3D Printer
The Bad Robin 3D Printer is an Open-Source 3D Printer project. Its goal is to provide an 
affortable, versatile and robust 3D Printer design.  
It was designed for the use in schools and universities, where the availablility of spare parts are key to the success
of a 3D Printer, and so it was designed to be able to produce its own spare parts. Also a school printer should be easy to store,
so this frame design was chosen to use as little shelf space as possible .  


### Main design features
- It is built-up of only well-established parts that are widely available.
- It features a new single-fan extruder desing for a super-light extruder with print cooling.
- It is parametric: Height, width or length may change, the 3D-Printed parts that make it up always remain the same.
- It is rugged: The base and frame are very strong if the printer ever becomes un-aligned it is very easy to fix.
- It provides superior quality prints: The desing is made to minimise vibrations and wobble making for great prints.
- It can replicate: Even the smallest (250mm) variant can print all the parts for its larger siblings.
- It is affordable: Depending on sourcing, the price does not exceed $250 for the 250mm version. 
- It is expandable: Multicolor or Heated printbed ? Everything is possible.
