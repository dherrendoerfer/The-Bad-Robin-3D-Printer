### Design decision:
The Z-Axis can be held in place by a 3D-printed part and a ball-bearing ball, or a different 3D-printed part and a bearing. For this mounting method the threaded rod needs to be machined to fit the bearing. (Items that this influences are marked with *)

### Bill of materials

- You need each and every stl file printed once, the feet 3 times.
- You need T-Nuts with M3, M5, and M6 screws in various sizes and lengths.
- You need a drill-press to drill two holes

for hints on what to get.

### Print settings for the 3D printed parts
* With 0.4mm nozzle diameter and PLA use 30% infill and 3 shell layers at least
* With 0.3mm nozzle diameter and PLA use 35% infill and 4 shell layers at least
* Use brim
* Use higher temp and low print speed for good layer-bond.
* Use a drill to bring each hole to required bore diameter
* Make sure to clean up all the edges of the prints before assembly.
